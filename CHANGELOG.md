# Change Log

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-26

### 🔧 Improved
- **Notification System**: Changed destructive command warnings from modal popups to VS Code warning notifications (yellow)

### ✨ Added
- **Command Palette**: Added "Claude Auto Responder: Start Claude Terminal" command for manual terminal startup
- **Unified Naming**: All command palette entries now start with "Claude Auto Responder:" to avoid confusion with official Claude extension

### 📖 Documentation
